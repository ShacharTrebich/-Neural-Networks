The project utilizes neural networks to identify blurry or imprecise numbers. 
It compares the results when the network consists of one hidden layer versus three hidden layers. 
It also evaluates the success rates of identifying blurry numbers under different learning group conditions, including printed numbers, some printed and some blurry, and when all the learning group consists of blurry numbers.
The learning process is based on the Delta Rule for weight updates, integrating this activation function as part of the Backpropagation algorithm.
